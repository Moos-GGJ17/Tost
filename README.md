# Tost
*by Moos*

So, you wanted WAVES? Waves you got.

Tost is a music wave-rhythm game where you can demonstrate your musical skills by catching all the lights.

You've got:
  * Light-formed Waves on the board.
  * Sound Waves in the beautiful music that comes out of your speakers/headphones.
  * Waves on the top to see if you're doing great (or failing, perhaps).
  * Waves that come out of each light by the rhythm of the music.
  * Even imaginary electromagnetic Waves on the toaster of the loading screen.

Objective? You've got this ball that moves constantly on zig-zag (it's also a Wave). With it, you'll try to collect as many lights as you can by hitting the Space button, that will make the ball bounce and change its direction. Challenging....but you won't give up ;)
